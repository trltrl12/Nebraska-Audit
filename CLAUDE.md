# Nebraska audit cash-flow pipeline

GitHub Actions does all downloading, trimming, validation and CSV/XLSX building. Claude sessions
only read trimmed PDFs (via the `extractor` subagent) and write JSON.

## Git rules
- Work directly on `main`: no side branches and no pull requests.
- Always run `git pull --rebase` before starting and before every push.
- Claude sessions only ever write to `output/json/` and `CLAUDE.md`. GitHub Actions owns everything
  else in `output/` (and `trimmed/`). This avoids merge conflicts.
- If a push fails, stop and tell the user.

## Layout
- `scripts/download.py` lists filings via the Auditor's search (POST to
  nebraska.gov/auditor/reports/index.cgi: type=audit, subtype, year, csv=1 export / csv=0 results)
  and downloads PDFs to `audits/` (gitignored). Raw search responses go to `output/listing_debug/`.
  `output/file_list.csv` records each filing's county, subdivision type and filing type (Audit/Waiver).
- `scripts/find_pages.py` saves the statement pages to `trimmed/` and writes `output/manifest.csv`.
- `scripts/validate.py` checks `output/json/` and writes `output/flagged.csv`.
- `scripts/build_csv.py` writes `output/cashflow_long.csv`, `cashflow_summary.csv`, `progress.csv`
  and `cashflow.xlsx`.
- `.github/workflows/fetch.yml` is run manually. `validate.yml` runs on each push to `output/json/`.
- `.claude/agents/extractor.md` is the extraction subagent. It holds the full schema and rules.

## Schema and category rules (summary; full rules are in the extractor agent)
One JSON per report: `output/json/<pdf stem>.json`. Fields: entity_name, entity_type,
fiscal_year_end, basis (`cash`|`GAAP`), extraction_attempt, beginning_cash, beginning_investments,
beginning_fund_balance, receipts[], disbursements[], transfers_in, transfers_out, debt_proceeds,
other_financing, adjustments[], reported_totals{receipts,disbursements}, proprietary (GAAP:
operating, noncapital_financing, capital_and_related_financing, investing, beginning_cash,
ending_cash), balance_sheet{statement, scope, column, assets[], deferred_outflows[], liabilities[],
deferred_inflows[], equity[], total_assets, total_deferred_outflows, total_liabilities,
total_deferred_inflows, total_equity}, ending_cash, ending_investments, ending_fund_balance, notes.
- Each report covers revenue sources, expenditures, and a balance sheet with all assets and
  liabilities (government-wide Statement of Net Position for GAAP; cash-basis net position
  statement otherwise). The link to the PDF on the Auditor's site (manifest `url`) is added to
  every output by build_csv.py; it is not stored in the JSON.
- Money values are `{"amount", "source_page"}`, where source_page is the page within the trimmed PDF.
  List items are `{category, original_label, amount, source_page}`.
- Receipt categories: property tax, sales tax, other taxes, intergovernmental/state aid, federal
  grants, charges for services/fees, investment income, other.
- Disbursement categories: general government, public safety, streets/highways,
  culture/recreation, health/welfare, economic development, utilities, debt service principal,
  debt service interest, capital outlay, other.
- Asset categories: cash and investments, receivables, due from other governments,
  inventories/prepaids, restricted assets, capital assets, other assets.
- Liability categories: accounts payable, accrued liabilities, due to other governments, unearned
  revenue, debt - due within one year, debt - due in more than one year, net pension/OPEB
  liability, other liabilities.
- Balance check: assets + deferred outflows = liabilities + deferred inflows + equity.
- Identity: beginning + receipts − disbursements + transfers_in − transfers_out + debt_proceeds +
  other_financing + adjustments = ending (cash for cash basis, fund balance for GAAP).

## Batch procedure
1. `git pull --rebase`.
2. Read `output/progress.csv`. Take the next `pending` reports, plus any `flagged` reports whose
   `extraction_attempt` is 1 (re-check each flagged report once; after that leave it for a human).
   You can do this with a short `python -c`/`grep` that prints filenames only.
3. Send them to the `extractor` agent in groups of about 5 reports per agent (several agents in
   parallel is fine). Pass only the filenames.
4. `git add output/json/ && git commit -m "extract: N reports"`, then `git pull --rebase && git push`.
   GitHub Actions validates and updates progress.
5. Repeat until the user's usage runs low, then report how many are done and how many remain
   (counts from `output/progress.csv` after a pull).

Keep the main session lean: don't open PDFs or print JSON in the main conversation. Rely on the
agents' one-line statuses.
